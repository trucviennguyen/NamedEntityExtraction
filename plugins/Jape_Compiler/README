Ontotext Japec Compiler
=======================

This directory contains the Japec JAPE-to-Java compiler, developed by Ontotext,
and a reimplementation of the standard JAPE transducer that uses Japec to
compile the grammar into Java, allowing much faster running times than the
standard transducer implementation.  Documentation describing how to use the
Japec transducer in GATE is given in the GATE user guide at

http://gate.ac.uk/sale/tao/#sec:misc-creole:japec

Building the compiler
---------------------

The Japec compiler is written in Haskell.  Compiled binaries are supplied for
Windows, Linux (x86) and Mac OS X (PowerPC), so it should work out of the box.
However, if there is no precompiled binary for your platform or if you need to
make changes to the compiler, you will need to build the compiler yourself.

To build Japec, you will need to install the latest version of the Glasgow
Haskell Compiler.  The included binaries were built with GHC version 6.4.1.
Once you have installed GHC, you can build the compiler using Ant:

../../bin/ant japec.clean japec

This will build the compiler and create the executable "japec" ("japec.exe" on
Windows) in the Jape_Compiler plugin directory.  The JapecTransducer will use
this in preference to the supplied "japec-<platform>".

*Note to committers: do not check the new binary into CVS unless you are sure
you know what you are doing.  Distributed binaries must be 'strip'ped and must
link statically to the GMP library.*
