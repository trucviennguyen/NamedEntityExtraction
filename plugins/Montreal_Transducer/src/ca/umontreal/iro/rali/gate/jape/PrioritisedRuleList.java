  * A list of rules ordered according to priority. May be used for ordering
  * non-matched rules (in which case the order is based on
  * priority/position), or matched rules (in which case the order is based
  * on matched lenght/priority/position). Note that position represents
  * the idea of order within an input file; it is assumed that this is the
  * same as the order of addition of the rules to the list, i.e. a rule
  * added 5th is assumed to occupy 5th place in the file (or other rule
  * source). This class is based on JGL's DList, which allows for fast
  * insertion of elements at any point. The highest priority rule is the
  * first in the list, which may be accessed by <CODE>front()</CODE>.
