      This set of packages implements the Montreal Transducer processing resource for GATE 2.1 (and higher).

      <p>
      The Montreal Transducer is similar to the ANNIE transducer included in GATE but it allows grammars with more powerful rules and it fixes a few bugs.  For a complete description of the changes, see the {@link ca.umontreal.iro.rali.gate.creole.MtlTransducer MtlTransducer} class.  Also make sure to read the README.html file distributed with the MtlTransducer.jar file.
